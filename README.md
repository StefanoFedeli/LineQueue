# Case Study LineQueue

System that is capable of maintaining a queue of text lines for access by clients.

## Architecture
A picture is better than hundreds of words
![Alt text](./docs/schema.png "Architecture")

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
The application can be deployed on Docker or in a Native enviroment
#### Docker
1. Install docker
```console
username@hostname:~$ apt install -Y docker
```
2. Use the build.sh script to create the needed Docker images
```console
username@hostname:~$ ./build.sh docker
```
3. Use the run.sh script to deploy the architecture
```console
username@hostname:~$ ./run.sh docker
```
#### Native
1. Install the needed package
```console
username@hostname:~$ apt install -Y openjdk-8-jdk python3 pip3
```
```console
username@hostname:~$ wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.9.0-bin.zip
username@hostname:~$ sudo mkdir /opt/gradle
username@hostname:~$ sudo unzip -d /opt/gradle gradle-6.9.0-bin.zip
username@hostname:~$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle-6.9.0/bin
```
2. Use build.sh script to create the jar and install dependencies
```console
username@hostname:~$ ./build.sh
```
3. Use the run.sh script to start both server and client
```console
username@hostname:~$ ./run.sh
```

## Requirements
- [X]  Application should be follow the command protocol defined in the given PDF.
- [X]  The system should perform well as the number of requests per second increases.
- [X]  The server should listen for connections on TCP port 10042.
- [X]  The application server should be implemented in any JVM compatible language
- [X]  The server must support at least a single client at a time. The server may optionally support multiple simultaneous clients.

## Known Issues
1. Input strings are not checked
2. The system is not easy to scale horizontaly 

## Scalability Consideration
The way the server is build doesn't let the system to be horizontally scalable. Add new server instances is not enough to scale the service as the state is not shared between istances. 
Scalability is however well achieved by improving the server. All the data structures are thread-safe and the application support multiple concurrent connection.
To solve horizontal scaling two path are available:
- Develop any type of consistency (eventual, casual, or other) to make more instances share a common state.
- Use OpenSource source projects, i.g. Kafka, to maintain a consistent, always available state and then deploy few instances that handle the application logic and keep track of the seeking index published as well on a Kafka topic. 


## Dependencies and Technologies
This project leverages a different set of technologies
- Docker: Fast deployment and portability. It makes easier to development
- Python: Fast development, easy threading. Perfect language for simulating jobs
- Kotlin: JVM Language, fast and very robust.
